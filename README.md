This repo include the prediction maps generated from [Badr et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.04.22277641).

## Naming convention
The filenames follow 13-characters naming convention:
- The first four letters are obviously the abbreviation of the pathogen (**shig** = Shigella).
- Then, two letters indicating whether it's the probability or standard error (**pr** = Probability | **se** = Standard Error).
- Next are four numbers giving the upper and lower bound of the age range of the estimate in months.
- After that is a one letter for the syndrome (**a** = Asymptomatic | **s** = Surveillance).
- Last comes two letters indicating if the study design (**hf** = Health Facility | **cs** = Community Surveillance).

## Funding
The research presented in this article was supported financially by NASA's Group on Earth Observations Work Programme (`16-GEO16-0047`), the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grant `1R03AI151564-01`, and the Department of Internal Medicine and the Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health of the University of Virginia. Further funding was obtained from the BMGF under `OPP1066146` to MNK. AJP is funded by Wellcome (`108065/Z/15/Z`). The funders played no role in the design and implementation of the study or the analysis and interpretation of the results.
